# EHRbase

EHRbase is an [openEHR](openehr.org) Clinical Data Repository, providing a standard-based backend for interoperable clinical applications. It implements the latest version of the openEHR Reference Model (RM 1.0.4) and version 1.4 of the Archetype Definition Language (ADL). Applications can use the capabilities of EHRbase through the latest version of the [openEHR REST API](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/latest/) and model-based queries using the [Archetype Query Language](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/QUERY/latest/AQL.html).

## Release Notes
##### 2020, January 10
This release brings EHRbase from a pre-alpha to an alpha version. Besides numerous bug fixes, EHRbase provides new endpoints based on the openEHR REST API to handle FOLDERS and the EHR_STATUS objects. This version also introduces Spring Transactions, improved handling of the system ID and AQL queries with partial paths finally return data in canonical json format (including full compositions). The conformance tests have been enhanced by adding AQL tests. Please see [EHRbase Documentation](https://ehrbase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/01_release_notes/0100.html) for further details. We still encourage the use of EHRbase for the purpose of development of openEHR applications and to make trial implementations of changes applicable to the openEHR Specification. However, a deployment in production with real patient data is not recommended yet.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Please read these instructions carefully. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need Java JDK/JRE 8 (preferably openJDK: e.g. from https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

You will need a Postgres Database (Docker image or local installation). We recommend the Docker image to get started quickly.

When installing locally, the Postgres Database (at least Version 10.4) needs the following extensions:
 * [temporal tables](https://github.com/arkhipov/temporal_tables) 
    ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/arkhipov/temporal_tables.git
     make
     sudo make install
     make installcheck
     ```
 * [jsquery](https://github.com/postgrespro/jsquery) 
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/postgrespro/jsquery.git
     cd jsquery
     make USE_PGXS=1
     sudo make USE_PGXS=1 install
     make USE_PGXS=1 installcheck
    ```

### Installing

#### 1. Setup database

> NOTE: Building EHRbase requires a properly set up and running DB for the following steps.

Run `./db-setup/createdb.sql` as `postgres` User.

You can also use this Docker image which is a preconfigured  Postgres database:
```
    docker run --name ehrdb -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -d -p 5432:5432 ehrbaseorg/ehrbase-database-docker:11.5
```
#### 2. Setup Maven environment

Edit the database properties in  `./pom.xml` if necessary

#### 3. Build EHRbase
Run `mvn package`

#### 4. Run EHRbase

Replace the * with the current version, e.g. `application/target/application-0.9.0.jar`

`java -jar application/target/application-*.jar`


## Running the tests

This command will run all tests from `tests/robot` folder.
DB and server application will be started/stopped by the tests accordingly. You *must not* start them by hand.

> NOTE: Make sure you meet the PREREQUISITES mentioned in tests/README.md prior to test execution.
>
> Please Check the README in `tests` folder for more details.

```bash
cd tests
./run_local_tests.sh
```


## Deployment

 1. `java -jar application/target/application-*.jar` You can override the application properties (like database settings) using the normal spring boot mechanism: [Command-Line Arguments in Spring Boot](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-command-line-arguments)
 2. Browse to Swagger UI --> http://localhost:8080/ehrbase/swagger-ui.html
