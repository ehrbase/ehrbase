-- following function needs to replaced by modified version without `contribution_history` reference too

-- ====================================================================
-- Description: Function to delete a single EHR's history, meaning the Status' history.
-- Necessary as own function, because the former transaction needs to be done to populate the *_history table.
-- Parameters:
--    @ehr_id_input - UUID of target EHR
-- Returns: '1'
-- =====================================================================
