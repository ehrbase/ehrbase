Main flow has existing COMPOSITION (FLAT)

Create Two Compositions With Health Care Facility Provided And Not Provided - AQL
    [Documentation]     Create first composition with health_care_facility provided;
    ...     Create second composition with health_care_facility not provided;
    ...     Apply AQL query to get EHR a/uid/value and a/context/health_care_facility/name.
    ...     In rows, first array should contain Hospital A and second array should contain null.
    ...     - https://github.com/ehrbase/ehrbase/issues/848
    ...     Second query checks the resulted columns data.
