Documentation   B.1.b) Alternative flow 1: Create same EHR twice
...
...             Flow:
...
...                 1. Invoke the create EHR service (for each item in the Data set with given ehr_id, data sets 9 to 16)
...                 2. The server should answer with a positive response associated to "EHR created"
...                 3. Invoke the create EHR service (for the same item as in 1.)
...                 4. The server should answer with a negative response, and that should be related with the EHR existence,
...                    like "EHR with ehr_id already exists"
...
...             Postconditions:
...                 A new EHR will exists in the system, the first one created, and be consistent with the data sets used.
...
