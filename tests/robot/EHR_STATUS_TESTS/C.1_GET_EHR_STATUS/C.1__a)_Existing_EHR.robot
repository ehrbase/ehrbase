Documentation   C.1.a) Main flow: Get status of an existing EHR
...             Preconditions:
...                 An EHR with known ehr_id should exist.
...
...             Postconditions:
...                 None
...
...             Flow:
...                 1. Invoke the get EHR_STATUS service by the existing ehr_id
...                 2. The result should be positive and retrieve a correspondent EHR_STATUS.
...                    The EHR_STATUS internal information should match the rules in which
...                    the EHR was created (see test flow Create EHR) and those should be verified:
...
...                    a) has or not a subject_id
...                    b) has correct value for is_modifiable
...                    c) has correct value for is_queryable
