For such data, it is important to devise the meanings (usually questions in subjective data)  carefully, so that the only allowed results are in fact true or false. \n\nMisuse: The DV_BOOLEAN class should not be used as a replacement for naively modelled enumerated types such as male/female etc. Such values should be coded, and in any case the enumeration often has more than two values. \n",
