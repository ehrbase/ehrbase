    "description": "Specification of the how the request should be processed by server. The request can be persisted in the server, meaning that a) it can be re-activated by the requesting system simply by indicating Request id, and b) that a changes-only pattern of Extract updates can be set up. To achieve this, the server has to remember what was sent in the previous response.\n\nThe update mode may be event-driven and periodic update or a mixture of both. The candidate items to be sent each time are the result of re-evaluating the content and versioning parts of the specification; what is actually sent is determined by the send_changes_only flag.",
