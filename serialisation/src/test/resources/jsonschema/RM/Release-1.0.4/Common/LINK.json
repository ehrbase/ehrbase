    "description": "The `LINK` type defines a logical relationship between two items, such as two `ENTRYs` or an `ENTRY` and a `COMPOSITION`. Links can be used across compositions, and across EHRs. Links can potentially be used between interior (i.e. non archetype root) nodes, although this probably should be prevented in archetypes. Multiple `LINKs` can be attached to the root object of any archetyped structure to give the effect of a 1->N link.\n\n1:1 and 1:N relationships between archetyped content elements (e.g. `ENTRYs`) can be expressed by using one, or more than one, respectively, `LINKs`. Chains of links can be used to see  problem threads  or other logical groupings of items. \n\nLinks should be between archetyped structures only, i.e. between objects representing complete domain concepts because relationships between sub-elements of whole concepts are not necessarily meaningful, and may be downright confusing. Sensible links only exist between whole `ENTRYs`, `SECTIONs`, `COMPOSITIONs` and so on. ",
