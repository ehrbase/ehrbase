# Updating EHRbase

This file documents any backwards-incompatible changes in EHRBase and assists users migrating to a new version.

## EHRbase 2.0.0

### Migrating data

EHRbase 2.0.0 comes with a completely overhauled data structure that is not automatically migrated when deploying this 
new version over an older data structure.

To support the migrating of data from systems `pre-2.0.0` to `2.0.0`, a migration tool and instructions are provided 
at https://github.com/ehrbase/migration-tool. 


## EHRbase 2.7.0

### EHR_STATUS and FOLDER consistency check

Updating an `EHR_STATUS` or `FOLDER` did not check the `If-Match header` against the DB. This allowed to pass in an 
invalid identifier that does not match the existing in the DB. This may have lead to inconsistent data in some systems. 

To check if any `EHR_STATUS` or `FOLDER` is affected run [ehrbase_2.7.0_check_ehr_status_and_folder_void](db_scripts/ehrbase_2.7.0_check_ehr_status_and_folder_void.sql).
In case you see an output like:
```text
Inconsistent EHR_STATUS found
Inconsistent FOLDER found
```
Please open an issue so that a fix can be provided.

## EHRbase 2.10.0

Starting from version 2.0.0 the ehrscape scape API was Deprecated. With the release of version 2.10.0, the API is now disabled and can be enabled by switching the configuration `ehrbase.rest.ehrscape.enabled` or as env var `EHRBASE_REST_EHRSCAPE_ENABLED` to `true`.
